I'm getting my MA in Educational Studies in Workforce Development with a specialization in Career and Technical Education at The Ohio State University.

I have a 2-Year Provisional Career-Technical Workforce Development (CTWD) license in Business Administration and Management. In order to advance to the 5-Year Advanced CTWD license, I have to complete a CTWD educator preparation program.

The licensure program at OSU is 27 credit hours. The Master's program 33-34 credit hours. My school district is paying for my classes, so it makes sense to take two extra classes to get a Master's degree, which comes with a nice 10% raise.
