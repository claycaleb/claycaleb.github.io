A digital garden is a place where ideas and connections grow. It's a knowledge management system. I imagine it's similar to a zettelkasten, but less organized. Gardens are messy.

The most exciting part about a digital garden to me is that it's a place to tinker with words and technology. It's a great place to find [[Flow|flow]]. I could spend hours tinkering with [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) or writing/rewriting/expanding.
