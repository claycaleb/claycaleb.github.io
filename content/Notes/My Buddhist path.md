I had been meditating regularly after reading *Mindfulness in Plain English* by Bhante Gunaratara in 2021. Meditation (and medication, and therapy) helped me recover from depression and anxiety.

I took refuge with Khenpo Ugyen Tenzin at Columbus Karma Thegsum Chöling (KTC) on 05/28/2022.

After that, I completed the "Dharma Paths Program" at Columbus KTC - an eight-class Introduction to Buddhism course. I read *Dharma Paths* by Khenpo Karthar Rinpoche sometime after that. 

I say that I'm a "bad Buddhist" for a few reasons. I can't seem to keep up a daily practice. Maybe one of these days. I also started [[Ngöndro notes|ngöndro]], an advanced Tibetan Buddhist practice in 2023. The first goal is to do 111,111 prostrations. I did 8,999 prostrations and stopped. I've been somewhat estranged from Columbus KTC since then.
