Thinking about the difference between quitting and pivoting. There’s merit in finishing what you start, but what’s worth finishing? The version of you that set a goal is different than the version of you that works toward the goal, and the outcome you wanted may not fit the context of your life once you’re in the middle of it.

There’s value in seeing a goal as a trajectory and being willing to pivot when a goal no longer serves you.

Or maybe there’s no way to tell if something is worth finishing until you’ve finished it, and I’m simply rationalizing pursuing the next shiny object when I get bored. Or is boredom a valid signal to stop?

Which me do I honor? Past-me that set the goal, or present-me that doesn’t feel like it’s worth it? What would future-me think?
