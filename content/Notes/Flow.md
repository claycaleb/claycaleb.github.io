Flow is a term defined by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. It's a state of mind where you lose track of time. You're doing something for the sake of the thing. 

I've found flow in a few memorable ways:
- Early morning Mario Kart time trials
- Solving a Rubik's cube and trying to perfect an algorithm or learn a new one
- Tinkering with this website (*three hours* disappeared as I made my [[Resume]])
- Music production in high school (EDM, trap, beats)
- Python programming in my Data Structures and Algorithms class in college
- Building web scrapers with Python
- Putting words together
- Editing those words
- Getting lost in a fiction [[Books|book]] 
- Climbing trees

I'm sure there are more. I seem to enjoy working on things with tight feedback loops and a kind of this-or-that mechanism. 

I think I'd enjoy rock climbing a lot. C. Thi Nguyen talks about rock climbing in his new book *The Score*. I'll have to try it out and see. Feeling inspired after seeing Alex Honnold climb to the top of Taipei 101.
