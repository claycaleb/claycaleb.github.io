From a Cal Newport podcast on "The Deep Life"

| **Phase 1**    | **Phase 2**    |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| Simplification | Legacy         |
| Craft          | Transformation |
| Control        | Service        |
| Discipline     | Values         |

Discipline involves having three keystone habits in the areas of body (exercise or nutrition), mind (reading), and heart (connecting with others). You could say body, speech, and mind if you’re Buddhist.

Control means getting control of all of your tasks. No open loops. Capture everything and get your arms around your work.

Craft involves doing something really well. It could be work-related or it could be a hobby. Craft also means to appreciate skill from others.

Simplification involves cutting the dead weight. Stop obligations that don’t add value.

Values is self explanatory. Figure out what your core values are! Cal mentions spirituality here.

Service involves being a leader and doing things for others.

Transformation is what people think about when they think of a deep life. Big meaningful, strategic, life-changing decisions.

Legacy - what are you going to leave behind?
