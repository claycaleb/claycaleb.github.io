*Subjects Matter: Exceeding Standards through Powerful Content-Area Reading* by Daniels and Zemmelman (p. 100)

Frontloading with images is a strategy where you use images to provide students context before a lesson. One way to do it is to show images on the board and ask students to note the similarities or differences in the images displayed. Students can make inferences and connections about the pictures.

It's important to think outside the box, or use humor. For example, if I were to teach a lesson on credit card debt, I could show an image of someone with a credit card in a hole, or someone with a Ferrari in front of a mobile home.
