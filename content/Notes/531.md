5/3/1 is a strength-building program created by Jim Wendler. I started seriously lifting in March of 2025 after starting and stopping a lot. I've tried Stronglifts 5x5 a few times, but the simplicity and philosophy behind 5/3/1 has stuck with me.

 5/3/1 is a four-week cycle of four main lifts: bench, squat, overhead press, and deadlift. Each week you do three work sets at a specified percentage of your "training max." Your last set is AMRAP, as many reps as possible. Your training max is roughly a three-rep max.

|       | Warm-up |      | Week 1 |      | Week 2 |      | Week 3 |      | Week 4 (Deload) |      |
| ----- | ------- | ---- | ------ | ---- | ------ | ---- | ------ | ---- | --------------- | ---- |
|       | Weight  | Reps | Weight | Reps | Weight | Reps | Weight | Reps | Weight          | Reps |
| Set 1 | 40%     | 5    | 65%    | 5    | 70%    | 3    | 75%    | 5    | 40%             | 5    |
| Set 2 | 50%     | 5    | 75%    | 5    | 80%    | 3    | 85%    | 3    | 50%             | 5    |
| Set 3 | 60%     | 3    | 85%    | 5+   | 90%    | 3+   | 95%    | 1+   | 60%             | 5    |

After each successful cycle you increase the weight: 5 lbs for upper body lifts, 10 lbs for lower body lifts.

Here is how much my estimated one-rep max has increased since April 2025 (estimated one-rep max - first week 3 AMRAP):

| Lift           | Weight  |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Bench          | +25 lbs |
| Squat          | +61 lbs |
| Overhead press | +32 lbs |
| Deadlift       | +77 lbs |

I try to lift 3-4 times a week. In reality it's more like 1-2x week on average. I track each of my workouts in a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KGRxok-6YAjUK9Nsu9ShDpIDyQtOWAYYifGQYk2KWXs/edit?usp=sharing).

My routine typically looks like this:
1. Warm-up for main lift
2. Main lift work sets
3. Related pull exercise
4. Complementary push exercise if I have time

I try to squeeze the entire workout into a 30-minute window.
