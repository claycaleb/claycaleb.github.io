*Originally published on Substack [here](https://substack.com/home/post/p-173317340).*

I turned 27 on Sunday. Here are 27 thoughts and reminders. These are things I’ve collected over the years and none of them are original. I even stole the idea to do this from [Jackson Dahl](https://jacksondahl.com/Posts/27+Pieces+of+Advice+on+my+27th+Birthday).

1. Major life decisions should [fit the context of your life](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/unfolding).
2. You can really do anything if you’re willing to accept the consequences.
3. Change is like gravity in that it can take a lot of effort to [get out of the orbit of your current habits](https://sammatla.com/hyperproductivity/).
4. I’ve realized most of my previous goals had all been an attempt to run away from what’s right in front of me.
5. Do what’s right in front of you.
6. Focus on how you can make an impact on others with the resources you have.
7. Some hard things are worth doing. Being consistent in how you show up for other people is one of those things.
8. Not all hard things are worth doing for the sake of doing hard work. [Take strategic shortcuts](https://usefulfictions.substack.com/p/fuck-willpower).
9. Read books. (I think of this in the same way [Michael Pollan says “Eat food.”](https://michaelpollan.com/books/in-defense-of-food/))
10. You can experience conflicting emotions at the same time. For example, you can feel grief due to lost opportunities and gratitude for what you have.1
11. Make it easy for other people to talk to you.
12. Learn peoples’ names and use them.
13. More people could benefit from [living their life like a bodhisattva](https://www.lotsawahouse.org/tibetan-masters/gyalse-thogme-zangpo/37-practices-all-bodhisattvas#:~:text=13.%20Even%20if%20others%20should%20seek%20to%20cut%20off%20my%20head%2C%0AThough%20I%E2%80%99ve%20done%20them%20not%20the%20slightest%20wrong%2C%0ATo%20take%20upon%20myself%2C%20out%20of%20compassion%2C%0AAll%20the%20harms%20they%20have%20amassed%E2%80%94this%20is%20the%20practice%20of%20all%20the%20bodhisattvas.).
14. Outsource all of the things your brain isn’t meant to do to technology – use a digital calendar, a task management app, and a budgeting app.
15. Be careful to outsource your thinking. Writing is thinking, and using AI to write robs you of that. (But sometimes you don’t want to think, and that’s okay.)
16. Create strict rules around your smartphone usage and stick to them.
17. Be intentional about how you spend your time – ideally you’d spend your time connecting with others, doing meaningful work, maintenance tasks, or resting to ensure you can be at your best.
18. Hanlon’s razor, but the compassionate version: don’t assume bad intentions when it could be due to limitations or a lack of understanding.
19. Prioritize sleep. An extra hour of work at night is never worth it.
20. If you’re consistently working on improving [a third of your days will feel good, a third will feel okay, and a third will royally suck](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/cKndqq0CsRc).
21. Very few people would like to admit it, but we have so little control. If you truly focus on what you can control, your focus becomes very narrow.
22. “Less is more” is true when it comes to responsibilities. Quality of your work matters more than quantity.
23. Love isn’t a feeling. You have to continuously choose to love through action.
24. There is value in thinking of your work in the same way a professional athlete does. Sleep, nutrition, preparation, and performance. [It’s okay to truly care about your work and aim for excellence, no matter what you do.](https://thegrowtheq.com/forget-too-cool-to-care-aim-to-be-great/)
25. Everyone is doing their best. And everyone could do better.
26. [You can choose what to believe.](https://sive.rs/run2) Beliefs should serve you in the same way that goals are meant to motivate you to take action.
27. Focus on the few things that give you the greatest returns. (Read roughly 20% of The 80/20 Principle to get the idea.)
