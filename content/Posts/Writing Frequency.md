Writing a daily blog post is fairly easy. Writing a high-quality, well-written daily blog post that adds value is hard. I am not Seth Godin. Moving forward, expect a weekly blog post from me. I am, once again, following Cal Newport’s advice. The three tenets described in his latest book *Slow Productivity: The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout* are 1) do fewer things, 2) work at a natural pace, and 3) obsess over quality. Writing less is the best way to focus on all three.

I had planned on publishing weekly when the school year begins, but I feel more busy now than I did during the school year. The yard sale nearly killed me, and my kids are home more often. I feel like I’m constantly cleaning to keep up with the wrath of a four-year old - I called her a “domestic terrorist” in conversation with my wife earlier. I now know what my mom, a teacher, went through with my siblings and I when we were kids. I appreciate her more now than ever.

Anyways, thanks for reading. Expect a better blog post sometime next week.
