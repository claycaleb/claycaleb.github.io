I like planning how to spend my time. It feels productive and like I have control over time (it’s nice to pretend). I use Cal Newport’s time-blocking method to schedule my alone/work time. It’s nearly impossible to time-block a day spent with two kids, so I’ve given up trying to structure days when my kids are home with me. Learn more about time-blocking [here](https://calnewport.com/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day/).

I also enjoy using this [Year at a Glance](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tPXaH1R8A3PkoRAzA_L-dNywQUzUUAXrlEeULvFxUTA/edit?usp=sharing) calendar I copied from [Ali Abdaal’s time management method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6o2tm00Ar8A). I made a similar [school-related calendar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19se7Yfk7EfquXoserZzUqFSJG_tqVx9sETYjcyB7Jpg/edit?usp=sharing) as well. You’ll have to replace the dates based on your district calendar. Feel free to copy these and use them!

Thanks for reading.
