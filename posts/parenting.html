<h2>A Mental Model for Parenting</h2>
<p>A few years ago, I was setting up my DJ equipment for a wedding and the photographer and I started talking about our kids and our parenting styles. My daughter was a toddler around that time. My wife and I had already determined that we wanted to take the best of how we were raised and leave the rest. We agreed not to hit or yell, and I didn't like the idea of timeouts. The photographer told me about the book <i>Hunt, Gather, Parent</i> by Michaeleen Doucleff. She told me how her four-year-old son started a load of laundry without being prompted after a few weeks of implementing the actionable advice in the book. I was intrigued. I ordered it right then and there.</p>
<p>In the book, Doucleff describes her time spent in three different continents (with her three-year old daughter!) studying how non-western parents parent. The non-western parenting practices represent how humans raised children for centuries. The hypothesis is that we've been thinking about parenting in the wrong way, and the book illustrates a more peaceful, joyful way to parent.</p>
<p>I've read <i>Hunter, Gather, Parent</i> multiple times now. I love the simplicity of Doucleff's "recipe" for behavior change:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Model (1 cup)</li>
    <li>Practice (1 cup)</li>
    <li>Acknowledge (1 tsp)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Model</h3>
<p>Kids do and say what their parents do and say. Any parent with a four-year old could tell you that. The question is, then, what are you modeling for your kids? What do you want your kids to do, and are you doing it yourself? Kids will follow your lead, in good ways and bad.</p>
<p>On days when my wife and I are particularly demanding, my daughter is too. When we ask less of her, she asks less of us.</p>
<h3>Practice</h3>
<p>Practice builds habits and skills. What opportunities do you provide for your kids to do what you want them to? If you want them to be helpful little humans, do you let them help when they want to? Before reading <i>Hunter, Gather, Parent</i>, I know I didn't. Doucleff says to accept help when your kids show an interest, even if the task will take twice as long (or longer).</p>
<p>What ways do your kids practice skills you <i>don't</i> want them to build? When I fall into the trap of arguing with my four-year old, she sees me model the behavior, and I give her the opportunity to practice arguing back. Note to self: don't argue with children.</p>
<h3>Acknowledge</h3>
<p>We western caregivers tend to overpraise our kids. "Great job coloring that picture!" "Great job brushing your teeth!" and so on and so forth. Why do we praise kids for trivial things? Why do we praise them for simply meeting expectations? Doucleff says to <i>acknowledge</i> the behaviors you want your kids to do more often. When we praise, and praise, and praise, kids expect more and more validation. It will take more and more praise and extrinsic motivation to get them to do anything. A simple, "You threw your trash away yourself" with a nod is much better than, "I love how you threw your own trash away!"</p>

<p>This model helps me think through many of my daily parenting decisions. <i>Hunt, Gather, Parent</i> is packed with other helpful tips and tricks, and it provides a solid framework to parent peacefully and joyfully.
