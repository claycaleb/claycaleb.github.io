<h2 id="content-title">Personal and Societal Gain</h2>
<small>JUN 10, 2024</small>
<p>Dave Stuart Jr. writes about how the central goal of education is students’ “long-term flourishing” in his book, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/These-Things-Teaching-Matters-Literacy/dp/1506391036">These 6 Things</a>. His definition of long-term flourishing has two parts: personal and societal. He uses <a target="_blank" href="https://positivepsychology.com/perma-model/">Marty Seligman’s PERMA Framework</a> to clarify personal flourishing and defines societal flourishing as “a life that <i>contributes to</i>, rather than <i>detracts from</i>, societal good." This led me to think about the relationship between personal gain and societal gain from a decision-making standpoint. Could the relationship between personal and societal gain look like the supply and demand curve? Could we optimize what’s best for ourselves and what’s best for the world? I have more questions than answers. Would personal gain mean perceived personal gain based on biological incentives like food, sex, or safety? If that’s true, what would be its inverse? Does maximizing societal gain mean no personal gain? These questions relate, in part, to a fundamental practice in Tibetan Buddhism called bodhicitta. Bodhicitta involves the belief that one is working toward enlightenment for the sake of all beings. There is a quote from the Dalai Lama that comes to mind here: “If you would like to be selfish, you should do it in a very intelligent way. The stupid way to be selfish is...seeking happiness for ourselves alone...the intelligent way to be selfish is to work for the welfare of others.” So societal gain is personal gain, if we’re able to get out of our way.</p>
<p>I started reading <a target="_blank" href="https://www.everythingisbullshit.blog/">David Pinof’s blog <i>Everything is Bullshit</i></a> yesterday. David is an evolutionary psychologist and the co-creator of Cards Against Humanity. His most popular blogpost is titled “<a target="_blank" href="https://www.everythingisbullshit.blog/p/happiness-is-bullshit">Happiness is Bullshit</a>." It's about how, from an evolutionary standpoint, we’re simply not wired to seek happiness. Our goal is to reproduce and we’re wired to do everything that increases our odds of that - eat copious amounts of food, gossip, lounge around, seek status, etc. Even our best habits are due to biological incentives - we say we work out because we want to live a long life and be healthy, but deep down we seek attention from potential mates. We meditate and tell others about it because we’re playing a status game of sorts. We foster meaningful relationships because our ancestors died when they didn’t. David’s view of the world is sobering and realistic. We are not wired to do what makes us happy. But in the comments on another one of his posts titled “<a target="_blank" href="https://www.everythingisbullshit.blog/p/theres-a-problem-with-our-desires">There’s a Problem with Our Desires</a>,” someone mentioned that Buddhism was “the way out” of the game. We may be the only species that realizes ourbiological desires and can choose to act differently with sufficient training (but even then, we may be subject to "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.everythingisbullshit.blog/p/incentives-are-everything">incentive determinism</a>").</p>
<p>If this “way out” is true on an ultimate level, then thinking about others more often than yourself makes sense. The idea is that the more you give the more you have to give. Tibetan Buddhism offers a way to increase both personal gain and societal gain through the Six Paramitas or the Six Perfections: generosity, discipline, patience, diligence, meditation, and wisdom. And if the Six Perfections push the personal gain curve to the right, our biological incentives, if left unchecked, push the curve to the left. In other words, our ego gets in the way. I don’t think Buddhists call our mind the "monkey mind" because we are primates, but it fits.</p>

<p>Like Pinof, I think meditation is good, but I don’t do it because of other incentives - like writing this blog for the chance at status and reputation someday (while telling myself I’m writing to add value), or cleaning my house because of some evolutionary benefit to having a clean living space for yourself, your partner, and your offspring.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.everythingisbullshit.blog/p/mediocrity-as-an-existential-risk/comments">Another one of David's posts</a> was about how the end of the world may not be a big bang like mass extinction due to AI or climate change - it maybe due to our mediocrity as humans. Someone in the comments said they’re not sure if we’re moving more toward Wall-E(best-case scenario) or Idiocracy (worst-case scenario). The future looks bleak. I’m hesitant to say that I’m hopeful, in part because Buddhists are encouraged to abandon all hope and fear, but maybe, just maybe, we primates will catch on to the fact that societal gain <i>is</i> personal gain.</p>
<p>Seth Godin published a handy little graph to use to assess the stories we tell ourselves:</p>

<p>He wrote, “When we act on something that’s useful and also true, we’ve found a resilient path forward. That’s because the truth doesn’t vary based on whether or not others choose to acknowledge it.” Based on the evidence I’ve gathered, bodhicitta, working for the benefit of others, is a resilient path forward. It is true in the sense that it’s what’s best for me and everyone else, too, regardless if anyone else realizes it.</p>
<p>Based on what I know, and what people more intelligent and enlightened than me know, doing things for others is a net positive for society and yourself. It’s not a zero-sum game where the other person wins and you lose. Generosity is additive, maybe even multiplicative, and we need to train our primate brain to think that way. Meditate and be generous with your time and attention. Use your skills to add value. Go make the world a better place. It will benefit you, too.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
<p>All the best,</p>
<p>Caleb</p>
