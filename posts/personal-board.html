<h2 id="content-title">Personal Board of Directors</h2>
<p>In Shane Parrish's book <i>Clear Thinking</i>, he writes that the people we spend our time with are the biggest influence on our behavior. He says that we learn best from others. If you don't have access to your role models you can imagine who you would choose as your personal board of directors. Your board can include real, living people, people from history, people you know personally, and even fictional characters.</p>
<p>You can consult your imaginary board when you're faced with a major decision, or imagine they're there with you during challenging situations. To make mine, I listed 30+ role models and influences and I've narrowed mine down to these seven. They're listed in no particular order.</p>
<ul>
    <li><p>Ch√∂gyam Trungpa - probably the most influential Buddhist teacher in the West.</p></li>
    <li><p>Fred Rogers - gool ol' Mister Rogers. An icon. Took risks and cared about the kids.</p></li>
    <li><p>Alex Hormozi - I admire his work ethic and his dedication to providing value to others.</p></li>
    <li><p>bell hooks - <i>All About Love</i> changed my life.</p></li>
    <li><p>Barrett Brooks - I've never heard someone's podcast and immediately wanted to be their friend.</p></li>
    <li><p>Cal Newport - Helped me become more focused and organized.</p></li>
    <li><p>Adam Grant - Great teacher and writer</p></li>
</ul>
