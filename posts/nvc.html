<h2 id="content-title">Creating Culture with Effective Communication</h2>
<p id="date">JUN 3, 2024</p>
<p>I picked up an interest in organizational culture recently. I stumbled upon the work of <a href="https://barrettbrooks.com/">Barrett Brooks</a>, a writer and executive coach that writes about leadership and building organizational culture. He has a great podcast called <i>Good Work</i> - his guests are founders or creators doing meaningful work. Him and his guests often talk about building company culture, values, and different leadership styles. His writing and his podcast have made me realize the lack of integrity in my workplace, as well as an assumed lack of integrity in workplace culture as a whole.</p>

<p>To be clear, I work with a lot of great people. My colleagues and I care about one another and our students, but without a well-defined, agreed-upon, positive school culture, the demands of the job can get the best of us. I've noticed an us-versus-them mindset amongst my colleagues - whether that be teachers-versus-admin or worse, teachers-versus-students.</p>

<p>One way to build a positive organizational culture is through shared norms of communication. With that should come the belief that conflict can be a force for good. Giving people the benefit of the doubt and remembering that everyone (hopefully) wants to make the company/school/world a better place should be a part of that, too.</p>

<p>I wish schools and workplaces offered more explicit training on communication. As teachers, communication makes up most of our job - communicating with students, parents, and colleagues. A year ago or so, I read <i>Say What You Mean</i> by Oren Jay Sofer. Sofer combines mindfulness practices with the principles of non-violent communication. The book made me realize the power and possibility of being present, listening, and effectively communicating your needs. It has completely changed how I think about and approach conflict. If everyone I worked with knew the non-violent communication framework for communicating their needs, and we all agreed on using it, we would all feel more connected, our work would feel more meaningful, and I think we would accomplish more.</p>

<h3>Observation, Emotions, Needs, Request</h3>
<p>The method for communicating your needs looks like this: you state what happened (observation), what you felt and how you feel about that (emotions), your needs or values related to those feelings (needs), and your request for whomever you're speaking to (request). The observation should be a non-biased, just-the-facts version of what happened from your perspective. You then state how the <i>observation</i> made you feel, not how the other person made you feel. This means taking responsibility for your own feelings. When you take responsibility for your emotions, there's no room to blame others for how you feel. It's helpful to think of emotions as data - they point to our basic human needs. Knowing what you need and value requires time for reflection, but it's key to working through conflict. Lastly, you make a simple, reasonable, actionable request. Let's go through an example.</p>

<p>My four-year-old daughter tends to yell at my wife and I when she doesn't get what she wants. I tried the non-violent communication method with her just the other day, after she had calmed down and was ready to listen (edited for clarity):</p>

<p><b>Observation</b> - "You yelled at me after I said that you couldn't have a popsicle."</p>
<p><b>Emotions</b> - "I felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed when you yelled."</p>
<p><b>Needs</b> - "I need our home to be peaceful and calm."</p>
<p><b>Request</b> - "Next time you feel like yelling, can you try to take a big deep breath so that you don't yell?"</p>

<p>She agreed to try, and I gave her the space to communicate how she felt as well. She still needs reminded not to yell at us, but I hope with time she'll learn not to. This example is a bit silly, but it's a powerful way to address conflict in any relationship. This framework, paired with a handful of shared beliefs on conflict and giving people the benefit of the doubt, could be a powerful way to create a postiive workplace culture.</p>

<p>I highly recommend Sofer's Say What You Mean. It is packed with ways to practice listening, being present, and speaking. It will change how you think about communication, conflict, and even what it means to be human. Get it <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Say-What-You-Mean-Communication/dp/161180583X">here</a>.</p>
