<h2 id="content-title">Copying, Classroom Management, and a New System for Passes</h2>
<small>JUN 12, 2024</small>
<p>Today I planned a lesson for the first day of school. “It’s June. We’ve only been out of school for two weeks!” you say. I know, I know. I am eager to get started, and I’m starting from scratch. Early bird gets the worm or something like that. Anyways, I plan to cover what students will learn, classroom expectations, and the structure of class. I have a notecard think-pair-share activity planned that I stole from Dave Stuart Jr. as well.</p>
<p>I am copying classroom rules and expectations from Michael Linsin, at the recommendation of Dave. I bought <a href="https://smartclassroommanagement.com/the-smart-classroom-management-plan-for-high-school-teachers/" target="_blank">The Smart Classroom Management Plan for High School Teachers</a> ebook for $7 on Michael’s website. I won’t give away all his secrets, but a major part of his classroom management plan is using listening and participation points. Each student starts with four points -  two listening points, and two participation points - every day. They lose points by breaking the rules, by <i>not</i> listening or participating.</p>
<p>Michael writes that teachers should be the referee in the classroom, politely but firmly letting students know when they’ve stepped out of bounds. Referees don’t yell, guilt, or bribe, they just provide warnings and consequences for behavior. I like his analogy - it provides a framework for managing classrooms in a fair, stress-free way. </p>
<p>Classroom management is my main focus this year. I’ve read (and experienced as a student) that great classroom management builds both credibility and belonging. It’s what I’ve struggled with the most in the past, and it is the foundation for learning. It’s like tilling your garden’s soil before planting seeds. </p>
<p>The writer David Perrell uses the motto, <a href="https://perell.com/essay/imitate-then-innovate/" target="_blank">“Imitate, then innovate.”</a> That is 100% what I am going to do this year. I am going to try to do what Dave and Michael do as much as I can, like a point guard would learn by trying to imitate Kyrie Irving. Combined, Dave and Michael have been teaching for 50+ years, and have been writing about teaching for 25+ years. It would be silly not to use their tried-and-true methods. </p>
<p>One thing I’m excited about is how I’m going to handle passes this school year. Our school uses Securly Pass (formerly e-hallpass) and I am going to let students create and accept their own passes. There will be a dedicated Chromebook in the back of the classroom used as a kiosk. Students will be able to create and accept their own passes with some constraints - only one student out at a time, and if a student takes longer than seven minutes, they’ll lose their pass privileges for the entirety of the quarter. In addition - at the recommendation of my mom, a kindergarten teacher - students will put a giant hand sanitizer bottle at their seat as a visual cue that someone is out on a pass. They’ll return the hand sanitizer to its rightful spot next to the Chromebook kiosk when they end their pass. </p>
<p>This system serves two purposes: one, I’m giving students the autonomy to go to the restroom when they need to, and two, I won’t have to handle their pass requests. Last year, I felt bombarded with pass requests and it interrupted teaching and learning. No longer! With this system in place, I’ll make at least 100 less decisions each day.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
<p>All the best,</p>
<p>Caleb</p>
