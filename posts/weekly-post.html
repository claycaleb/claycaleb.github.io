<h2 id="content-title">An Update</h2>
<small>JUN 18, 2024</small>
<p>Writing a daily blog post is fairly easy. Writing a high-quality, well-written daily blog post that adds value is hard. <a href="https://seths.blog/" target="_blank">I am not Seth Godin.</a> Moving forward, expect a weekly blog post from me. I am, once again, following Cal Newport’s advice. The three tenets described in his latest book <i>Slow Productivity: The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout</i> are 1) do fewer things, 2) work at a natural pace, and 3) obsess over quality. Writing less is the best way to focus on all three.</p>
<p>I had planned on publishing weekly when the school year begins, but I feel more busy now than I did during the school year. The yard sale nearly killed me, and my kids are home more often. I feel like I’m constantly cleaning to keep up with the wrath of our four-year old - I called her a “domestic terrorist” in conversation with my wife earlier. I now know what my mom, a teacher, went through with my siblings and I when we were kids. I appreciate her more now than ever.</p>
<p>Anyways, thanks for reading. Expect a better blog post sometime next week.</p>
<p>All the best,</p>
<p>Caleb</p>
