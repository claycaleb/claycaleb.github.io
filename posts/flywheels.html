<h2 id="content-title">Life Flywheels</h2>
<small>JUN 5, 2024</small>
<p>Flywheels are a type of mechanical device used to store potential energy and turn it into rotational energy. They take a lot of energy to turn at first, but less and less energy is needed once they are in motion. Once they start they will keep rotating. They are hard to stop. They are used to provide a continuous output of energy from intermittent inputs. A pottery wheel is a good example - the wheel spins continuously while the potter pedals intermittently.</p>

<p>We can build a flywheel to help propel us toward our goals with our habits. <b>What habits can you build into your life that provide continuous energy toward your goals? What habits fuel your other habits?</b></p>

<p>For me, getting consistent sleep helps me make better decisions. If I stay up late the night before, I'm more likely to stay up the next night. The opposite is true, too.</p>

<p>If I'm well-rested, I'm less reactive. I'm able to be more present with my kids and my wife. Quality time with them makes me happy, and that leads to better health, which leads to better sleep... and so on.</p>

<p>I see a handful of different flywheels in my habits. Reading and listening to content that aligns with my long-term goals and who I want to be propels me forward toward those goals. Writing leads to a better understanding of what I've read, which leads me to ask more questions and read more.</p>

<p>I met with a mindset coach a few years ago and we discussed the idea of personal growth as an upward spiral, like a slinky, as opposed to a hamster wheel. If you're in a hamster wheel, your day is filled with unconscious choices. You may work hard but you have nothing to show for it. If you see personal development as an upward spiral, with good habits supporting other good habits, you continue "leveling up" so to speak. Using both of these models, the flywheel and the upward spiral, can help you visualize how to spend your time to help you meet your long-term goals. </p>
