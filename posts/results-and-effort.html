<h2 id="content-title">Want Results? Try Persistent Effort</h2>
<p id="date">JUN 4, 2024</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
        “Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.”
        <br>
        — Calvin Coolidge

<p>I helped a friend move last week and I got paid in pizza and books (the best forms of payment). One of those books was The Dip by Seth Godin. Godin describes the relationship between results and effort when you're working toward anything worth working on. It's called, "the dip," naturally, and it looks like this:</p>

<img style="width: 50%;" src="https://travisstephens.me/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/seth-godin-the-dip.jpg">

<p>It reminded me of a graph in James Clear's Atomic Habits titled "The Plateau of Latent Potential."</p>

<img style="width: 50%;" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:705/1*u7aERFwzRl0d8u_OzzOZcw.jpeg">

<p>Both of these graphs show the relationship between results and time or effort. Time and effort are the same for the purpose of this post. <b>They both show that persistent effort over time leads to exponential results.</b></p>

<p>Clear's graph doesn't show the excitement of starting a new project or habit, whereas Godin's does. I've seen that pattern in myself - I'll start a project and make progress because I'm excited about doing something new. Then, the novelty wears away. Once I get bored or experience any kind of set back (the Dip), I quit.</p>

<p>The initial rise in results (or perceived results) in Godin's model could also be due to the Dunning-Krueger effect, or an "illusion of knowledge." We tend to overestimate how well we know a topic at first due to not understanding the complexities of it. I experienced this when I first started to meditate. I would try to teach others how to do it or explain the process like I was an expert. And eventually, the novelty wore away, and my daily practice crumbled. I am just now starting to build a formal meditation habit back up.</p>

<p>The Valley of Disappointment in Clear's model is the Dip. Clear defines it as "where people feel discouraged after putting in weeks or months of hard work without any results." Godin defines the Dip as "the long slog in between learning and mastery."</p>

<p>I appreciate that Godin's graph shows an initial bump in results, though I think we tend to overestimate our level of progress when we take our first steps (though getting started is often the hardest part). I like that Clear's graph shows the difference between our results and where we think we should be, and he gives actionable advice on sticking with the habits that will help us achieve our goals.</p>

<p>I'm writing this to remember it later - I'll realize I'm in the Valley of Disappointment/the Dip soon enough. Writing a blog post is easy. Writing a blog post every day, consistently, is hard. So, to future me - keep showing up.</p>
