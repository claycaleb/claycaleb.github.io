<h2 id="content-title">One Quote, Three Questions</h2>
<small>JUN 6, 2024</small>
<p>My goal was to write about goal setting today. My plan was to have an hour or two of alone time this morning to write, but my son woke up at 5:00 a.m. and my daughter woke up 30 minutes later. I don't want Daniel Tiger to parent my four-year old all day, so, here is a quote and three questions:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>'It's difficult to prevent the trivial from creeping into every corner of your schedule if you don't face, without flinching, your current balance between deep and shallow work, and then adopt the habit of pausing before action and asking, "What makes the most sense right now?"'
        <br>

<b>
    <p>What work-related tasks really move the needle?</p>
</b>
<b>
    <p>How do you track how you spend your time?</p>
</b>
<b>
    <p>What does your ideal day look like and how can you make today look more like it?</p>
