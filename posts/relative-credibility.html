<h2 id="content-title">Relative Motion, Credibility, and Fatherhood</h2>
<small>JUN 16, 2024</small>
<p>Happy Father’s Day! Short post after a brief break from writing - a yard sale consumed my entire life for two days.</p>
<p>If you’re on a plane, you don’t feel like you’re moving fast. If someone sees the plane fly by, it looks fast. And it is moving fast - 550 miles per hour or so. Both you and the observer are flying around the sun at 67,000 miles per hour, and neither of you feel that either! Relative motion relates to human behavior in that we have a relative view, from our own limited perspective. We're biased not to see our own blindspots, but we can point out others’. We are never the crazy ones and we’re always justified.</p>
<p>At times I forget that my students are teenagers trying to navigate the demands of high school. It’s easy for me to say, “What was he thinking?” or “I just can’t believe she did that,” but we all act on whatever incentives are in front of us. Some of my students’ decisions just will not make sense to me, but I have to remember that all behaviors are relative. To quote Ted Lasso, “Be curious, not judgemental.”</p>
<p>What things are in your control that influence student behavior? The one thing that comes to mind for me is credibility - Dave Stuart Jr. defines it as care, competence, and passion. Do you show that you care about your students? Do you really know your stuff and are you confident? Do you convey that you enjoy what you do?</p>
<p>Student motivation and fatherhood aren’t one to one, but I’ve been thinking about credibility in my role as a dad. I’ve made a point to start telling my four-year old that I love being her dad and I try to express how much joy she brings me. I get the sense that care and passion go a long way in both of my roles as a teacher and a dad. While the roles are symbiotic and I’ve learned a lot so far, I’m still figuring out that competence part.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
<p>All the best,</p>
<p>Caleb</p>
